## Virtualization

Hardware Assisted: Gives seperate images to processes
Para-virtualization: The compilers copiles in such a way that the process is self contained with virtual resources
OS: Containers, jails, Chroot, zones

**Native and Full Virtualization**: The VM simulates enough hardware to allow an unmodified guest. Runs on top of a hypervisor.

Examples include: VirtualBox, VMWare, Virtual PC

**Hardware Enabled Virtualization**: the virtual machine has its own hardware and allows a guest OS to be run in isolation

Examples: VMWare Fusion, Parallel Desktops on Mac and Windows

### Software Defined Networks

Allows you to define a virtual network using the underlying network architecture.
