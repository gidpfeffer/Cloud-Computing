## Options in the Cloud

Infrasructure as a service: providing an infrastructure for people to use with their programs. AWS for example

Software as a service: Providing a software that people use.

Platform as a service: Provide a service for people to run thair own applications on.

## Pricing

If you want to host entirely on your own, then you pay more when less people are using. This is because hosting on your own requires that you can always support the maximum traffic. 

A good approach is the hybrid approach. In the hybrid approach, you support the average demond with your own hosting, and when demand exceeds that, you transition to the cloud.
