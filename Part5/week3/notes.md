# Week 3

## SDN Architecture

Label Switch or MPLS allowed for explicit paths between classes of traffic.

Active Networks allowed for packet headers to carry pointers to program code that the router switch should execute.

Ethane allowed for centralized expression of a policy to be implemented from a controller that was programmable.

If hardware has explicit APIs, then software can more directly access device behavior and changing hardware is easier. 

SDN's seek to allow for a logically centralized controller. It is not literally centralized since all of the same problems involved with fault tolerant consensus in distributed systems are still applicable here.
